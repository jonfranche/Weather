This project is a web app that allows the user to search any area in the world using
a city name or zip code. The program will take the user input and retrieve weather data of
that areafrom Open Weather using their API. The user can choose to see the temperature in
either Fahrenheit or Celcius. The background of the website will change based on the weather of
the area that is searched.
